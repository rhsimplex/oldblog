Another big project from ascribe, which I played a small part in.  From our [website](https://www.bigchaindb.com/):

>BigchainDB allows developers and enterprise to deploy blockchain proof-of-concepts, platforms and applications with a scalable blockchain database. BigchainDB fills a gap in the decentralization ecosystem: a decentralized database, at scale. It is complementary to decentralized processing platforms like Ethereum, and decentralized file systems like InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
