[Alex Kern](https://github.com/kern) and the [Pavlov team](https://pavlovml.com/) have built a containerized, scalable reverse image search based on my [image-match library](https://github.com/ascribe/image-match).  They also added a nice REST API, which makes it much more useful for the typical user.

They even have a logo! So jealous!

So thanks, and congrats on the release.

PS [image-match](https://github.com/ascribe/image-match) has over 800 stars on github as of this writing!
