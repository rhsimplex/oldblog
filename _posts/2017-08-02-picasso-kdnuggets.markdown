Our [Picasso project](https://github.com/merantix/picasso) was featured in the August issue of [KDNuggets](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/08/visualizing-convolutional-neural-networks-open-source-picasso.html), a machine learning newsletter.

It's just the same as our Medium post, but a nice recognition nonetheless:
