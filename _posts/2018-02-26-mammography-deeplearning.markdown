title: Deep Learning in Mammography at the Berlin Machine learning meetup
layout: post
---
I gave a talk earlier this February [at the Berlin Machine Learning Group](https://www.meetup.com/berlin-machine-learning/events/246637245/) on the role of deep learning in mammography, and how we approach the problem at [Merantix](http://www.merantix.com) specifically.

Unfortunately, the talk was only live streamed and not recorded. However, [the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XiR8Z6gEfbyA_xFF1Ok8HDk8lI8aGsz3qsSvAGgMT-c/edit?usp=sharing) are available.
